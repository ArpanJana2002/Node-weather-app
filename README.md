🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: A Weather App! 🌦️

I recently completed a weather app built using a powerful stack of technologies: Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was an exciting opportunity to combine server-side and client-side skills to create a seamless user experience.

Tech Stack Used:
Node.js & Express.js: For building the server-side logic and handling API requests.
HTML & CSS: To design a clean and responsive user interface.
JavaScript: For dynamic interactions and fetching real-time weather data.
Features:
Enter any city to get the current weather.
View temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Simple and intuitive design for a smooth user experience.
Deployment:
I deployed the app using Railway, making it accessible online. You can check out the live demo here: https://node-weather-app-production-bf9f.up.railway.app/

Feel free to explore the app, and let me know your thoughts! 🌟
